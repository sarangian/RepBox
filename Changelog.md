# Changelog

The original bash scripts of RepBox have been transformed into subprocesses within a Python framework, enhancing user interactivity and facilitating ease of utilization. By consolidating the scripts into a single Python script, each command is now invoked as a subprocess. Furthermore, the inclusion of individual parameters in each command ensures that the optimization outputs remain unaltered.

The installation instructions for pipeline dependencies have been revised to accommodate the modified implementation of the pipeline script.

The `setup_repbox.sh` file has been updated to align with the changes made to the pipeline and script.

Additional packages, which may pose challenges in terms of user download or require more than the standard wget, make, or make install commands, have been incorporated for ease of accessibility.
